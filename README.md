# 'Spontaneous Node'

### A personal MEAN boilerplate
    
  This is where I merge up all my frontend solutions from various work/personal projects into one foundational template. When I find a nifty way of structuring/doing stuff, I'll dump it here so I can reuse it for next time.

  I may or may not turn it into a yeoman generator at some point.
    
### Frontend 7th Symphony, composed by Wolfgang Gulpenstein
  - A meaty **gulpfile** that works alongside **skeleton structures** for...
  - **OOSCSS**
    - *SASS* preprocessor
    - *Normalize.css* by (@necolas v3.0.2)
    - *clrs.cc* (@mrmrs v2.0)
  - **AngularJS** & **Angular UI Router**

  NB: All outdoor-facing frontend assets distribute to `/assets/(styles|scripts|images|...)`

### TODO: Backend Overture, by the massed phillharmonic Node/Sails orchestra
  - An optional skeleton for **Node.js** development utilising...
  - **Sails.js** 
  - **Swig** html rendering
  - **Passport.js** auth
  - **Orchestrate.io** data service (via sails-orchestra adapter)
